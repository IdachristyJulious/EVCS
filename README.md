##  Comprehensive Usage Guide

### **Installation & Setup**
Follow these steps to set up and run the code:

1. **Install MATLAB** (R2021a or later recommended).
2. **Ensure Required Toolboxes are Installed** (see Dependencies & Requirements below).
3. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/IdachristyJulious/EVCS.git
   cd EVCS
   ```
4. **Open MATLAB and Set the Path:**
   - Open MATLAB.
   - Navigate to the repository folder.
   - Run `startup.m` to initialize dependencies.

### **Running the Code**
Execute the main script in MATLAB:
```matlab
run('EVCmain.m')
```
This will process the input images using visual cryptography and display the results.

### **Input Format**
- The input should be RGB images in `.png` or `.jpg` format.
- Images should be placed in the `input_images/` directory.

### **Interpreting Output**
- The processed images and cryptographic shares will be saved in the `output/` directory.
- The visual cryptography scheme will generate two shares that can be combined to reconstruct the original image.

##  Dependencies & Requirements
Ensure the following MATLAB toolboxes and libraries are installed:

- **Image Processing Toolbox**
- **Computer Vision Toolbox**
- **Signal Processing Toolbox**
- MATLAB version **R2021a or later**

Install missing toolboxes using:
```matlab
matlab.addons.install('ToolboxName')
```

## Key Algorithm Descriptions
### **Algorithm Overview**
The system implements a **Visual Cryptography Scheme (VCS)** with enhancements for secure medical image sharing. The key steps include:

1. **Preprocessing:** Convert images to Halftone Images.
2. **Share Generation:** Split images into multiple shares using a matrix-based cryptographic approach.
3. **High-Level Synthesis:** Optimize the algorithm for performance efficiency.
4. **Reconstruction:** Combine the shares to retrieve the original image.

### **Mathematical Model**
The scheme follows a probabilistic model where each pixel in the original image is divided across multiple shares, ensuring that no single share reveals information.

##  Experimental Reproducibility
### **Example Datasets**
We provide sample input images in the `input_images/` folder for easy replication.

### **Replication Steps**
1. Download the dataset or use your own images.
2. Run `EVCmain.m` to generate cryptographic shares.
3. Compare the reconstructed images with the original images.
4. Evaluate performance metrics like **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)** and execution time.
